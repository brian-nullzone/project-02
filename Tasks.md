- I made some small changes to both the frontend and the backend. However, the changes you tried to apply were not implemented, and they are necessary for the project’s development. Don’t worry, it’s easy to fix. I sent you some instructions to your Gmail so you can help me with that — it’s VERY IMPORTANT that you complete them as soon as possible. Thank you! Best regards!
